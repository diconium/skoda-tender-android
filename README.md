## Design Considerations
 
### User Interface
- **Material Design**:  
  - Applied Android's Material Design components like `MaterialButton`, `TextInputLayout`, `RecyclerView`, and `CardView`.
  - Material themes are set in the `styles.xml` file with `Theme.MaterialComponents.*` themes, using predefined styles from Googleâ€™s Material Design library.
  
- **Responsive Layout**:  
  - Designed for various screen sizes and orientations with `ConstraintLayout`.
  - Separate XML layout files are created for different configurations (e.g., `res/layout`, `res/layout-large`).
  - **ViewModel and LiveData** are used to handle configuration changes seamlessly.
 
- **Accessibility**:  
  - Ensures usability for people with disabilities, including support for screen readers and high-contrast themes.
  - Important visual elements have content descriptions.
  - Text sizes are adjustable using `sp` units, with `android:autoSizeTextType` applied to `TextView`.
 
### Performance
- **Optimized API Calls**:  
  - Reduced latency with efficient network handling.
  - Implemented caching strategies using OkHttp's built-in caching for offline network responses.
 
### Security
- **Secure Connections**:  
  - Enforced HTTPS for all network communication to maintain data security.

## Integration
 
### Third-Party Services
- **Analytics**:  
  - Integrated Firebase Analytics for tracking user engagement.
 
### Local Data Storage
- **Room Database**:  
  - Used for local caching of user preferences and data.
 
### Backend API Integration
- **Retrofit**:  
  - Utilized for efficient HTTP communication.
- **OkHttp**:  
  - Manages network requests, with GSON used for JSON parsing to facilitate smooth backend API integration.

## Testing
 
- **Testing Configuration**:  
  - Configured with dependencies like JUnit and Espresso to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
